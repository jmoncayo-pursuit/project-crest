# Product Overview

Project Crest is an AI-powered Chrome browser extension and local agent that automatically adjusts YouTube video volume to prevent jarring loud moments. The system creates a pleasant, consistent listening experience by intelligently detecting loud events from subtitle text and preemptively lowering volume.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Proactive Volume Management**: Uses AI to predict loud moments before they happen
- **Seamless Integration**: Works transparently with YouTube without user intervention  
- **Smart Detection**: Analyzes subtitle text like "[explosion]" or "[gunshot]" to identify loud events

## Target Use Case
Users watching YouTube videos with dynamic audio (action movies, gaming content, music videos) who want consistent volume levels without manual adjustment.

## Hackathon Context
Built for NYC AI Agents Hackathon to demonstrate integration of sponsor technologies:
- Kiro IDE (AI-assisted development)
- Structify (data processing) 
- OpenAI (AI reasoning)
- TrueFoundry AI Gateway (API management)
- Datadog (observability)

The focus is on creating a compelling end-to-end demo that showcases intelligent agent behavior with production-ready observability.
