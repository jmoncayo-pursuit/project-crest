# Requirements Document: Volume Normalization Enhancement

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing Project Crest's volume normalization system to provide more consistent audio management and improved agent dashboard functionality. The current system can detect loud events and adjust volume, but needs improvements in normalization consistency, response timing, and dashboard data visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Consistent Volume Normalization

**User Story:** As a user watching YouTube videos, I want the volume adjustments to be smooth and consistent, so that I don't experience jarring volume changes or missed loud events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a loud event is detected THEN the system SHALL apply volume reduction within 200ms of detection
2. WHEN multiple loud events occur in sequence THEN the system SHALL maintain reduced volume until all events complete
3. WHEN volume is being restored THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions over 500ms instead of instant changes
4. WHEN the AI confidence is low THEN the system SHALL apply partial volume reduction (50% instead of full reduction)

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Agent Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer demonstrating the system, I want the agent dashboard to show real-time activity and metrics, so that judges can see the AI agent working intelligently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension popup is opened THEN it SHALL display real-time statistics including detection count, accuracy rate, and last action timestamp
2. WHEN a volume adjustment occurs THEN the dashboard SHALL update within 1 second showing the event details
3. WHEN AI decisions are made THEN the dashboard SHALL log the decision reasoning and confidence level
4. WHEN user corrections occur THEN the dashboard SHALL track and display the correction rate as a learning metric

### Requirement 3: Improved Audio Event Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to catch more loud events accurately, so that my listening experience is consistently comfortable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subtitle text contains sound effect indicators THEN the system SHALL detect them with 95% accuracy
2. WHEN audio analysis data is available THEN the system SHALL combine it with subtitle analysis for better decisions
3. WHEN the system makes incorrect decisions THEN it SHALL learn from user volume corrections to improve future accuracy
4. WHEN processing subtitle text THEN the system SHALL handle various formats including [sound], (sound), and descriptive text

### Requirement 4: Real-time Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the volume adjustments to happen quickly and smoothly, so that loud sounds don't startle me before the system reacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the server SHALL respond within 100ms for cached decisions
2. WHEN making AI calls THEN the system SHALL use request caching for identical subtitle text within 30 seconds
3. WHEN network latency is high THEN the system SHALL fall back to local heuristic decisions after 500ms timeout
4. WHEN multiple requests are pending THEN the system SHALL queue and batch process them efficiently
